Hello!
This is a little message from the creator of the site :)
Please give this a quick read if you stumble across it bc it will give you a good idea on the site layout and a few tips about CaseIT itself and your role!

Note this site was designed and created in 2024 so it may be outdated for you but I hope it doesn't get as messy as the older website I worked on before this... 


---CODE BASE---
This site uses Tailwind and Next.js with some React components for states
I've created MANY Tailwind variables in the config file for colours and fonts. 
This should be as standard as it comes unless a huge design change comes. But I did mess up the font sizing a bit because I eyeballed it based on the Figma, not the best way but it worked. 

Then the images, svgs, fonts, are in Public 
If you are new, please look into how to use SVG as it is important for logos and icons
We have also had issues with image optimizations so please optimize the sizing of them so they load faster
For old photos that are updated to the current year, I recommend making a separate folder for old folders then adding the new one. Or directly edit the title of the image to the year.

This is a new concept but KEEP ALL TEXT IN THE CONTENT FILES
Unless there is a large design update, each year will most likely just be a content change. I made it easier by placing all the content in files
So when you go in there to edit, you shouldnt need to dig through all the components. There are some instances like the Footer, but I don't prospect larger footer changes so I kept it all together.

Then we have Components and Hooks
These are just the reuable JS objects that get imported into the pages

Site routering and pages are in App
To create a new page, make a new Folder and name it as the desired page and make a page.tsx file - that's just the current vercel system.
I created subfolders based on the sites navigation so it not all scrambled. The subpages should exist in their parent-page-Folder

The most important things is upkeeping the organization of these files
Then familiarizing with the Tailwind variable are second

I don't prospect huge changes in the future, but faculty is faculty, so if there are changes, please prioritize organization and reducing the amount of repetitive code (good code practice, yknow)



---Authors Note and Tips!---
I made this site in my 5th year and Tailwind was something new to me. So I hope this helps you build some confidence in web development and CS
This is my second year of CaseIT, but although I am the director, I still reach out to the previous director for help. So as my last project, this is like handing off my legacy. 
Feel free to reach out for help, the entire webdev line has seemed really happy to help the new Director each year

For your CaseIT term, I want to stress how important it is push back and be firm with what you are capable of. 
Many students don't understand how long it takes to develop something and think this is as easy as using WIX, which I almost used instead of making this new site because you gotta think... is it all worth it
I pushed really hard to get 2 associates for web dev, which has never happened before. But if I didn't I wouldnt be surprised if they expected the same work with only 2 people
Be clear with yourself what you are capable of along with your course load because tasks WILL be sprung onto you. Sponsorships get finalized late then you need to update the site. It really depends if you have a good VC 
Web dev itself, is a more isolated position bc Beedie student don't code. So be cautious if they ask too much from you and expect fast results. 
I tried to make it as simple moving forward, but when faculty wants, they can flip the site upside down bc they don't like where a button is placed and you need to redo something.
I didn't do it think year because I CANNOT, but PIVOT will probably ask for a re-design soon 
Just know and remember, you are most likely the only team to know how to code, so you must know your skill and what is possible this term (10 months) so feel free to say no, I can't add this line here because its not a priority

But other than that, CaseIT has its ups and down, please have fun. Try to ignore all the stress that will build up throughout the term and find something to sustain yourself. 
I did this 2 times, I almost didn't do the 2nd term, but just remeber, this is just a school club, its not life and death. 
After CaseIT you'll learn alot about yourself and I find that worth more than just networking



---BYE---
Anyways, good luck to your term!
Please keep this file here if you see it, and feel free to add to it at the end of your term <3
Most of OC will probably NEVER look here, so this can be a little time capsule file until it gets wiped
