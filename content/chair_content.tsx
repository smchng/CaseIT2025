        On behalf of the 2025 Organizing Committee, it is our honour to welcome
        you to CaseIT 2025.
      </p>
      <p>
        With great excitement, we are embarking on another remarkable year of
        CaseIT where we bring together a talented group of individuals to
        challenge conventional thinking and bridge the gap between business and
        technology. Since its inception in 2004, with the support of our
        sponsors, CaseIT has grown from a local competition to one of the most
        prestigious undergraduate MIS case competitions around the world. We
        have welcomed over 1,000 undergraduate competitors from 51 universities
        and 20 countries to participate in our week-long competition in the
        beautiful city of Vancouver, British Columbia.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our organizing committee is fully committed to providing an
        unparalleled, rigorous, and engaging competition for talented business
        students to challenge themselves on an international stage. Our team
        aims to provide a platform for this talented cohort to showcase their
        analytical skills and technology expertise while engaging in building
        meaningful global connections throughout their experience. We aim to
        produce a memorable competition experience and create a lasting impact
        on our attendees.
      </p>

      <p>
        We kindly invite you to support this world-class business case
        competition and its impact on technology-focused undergraduate programs.
        CaseIT provides the unique opportunity to reach and connect with a local
        and international audience of change-makers who are passionate about
        leveraging information systems to reshape and challenge the boundaries
        between technology and business. We implore you to explore our financial
        and in-kind related sponsorships to identify the best option that
        provides your organization with the greatest value.
